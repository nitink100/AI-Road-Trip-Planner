# AI-Powered Python Road Trip Planner üó∫Ô∏è

Built with Python, this smart command-line tool leverages the Google Maps Directions API for routing and the Google Gemini LLM for AI-powered enrichment. The application functions as a travel concierge by implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to deliver intelligent, context-aware suggestions beyond simple navigation.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dynamic Itinerary Generation:** Plan trips with custom starting points, destinations, and departure times.
- **Google Maps Integration:** Fetches real-time route data, including distance, duration, and step-by-step instructions.
- **AI Travel Concierge:** Ask for recommendations about your trip! The AI can suggest interesting stops, restaurants, or activities based on your interests and budget.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** The AI's suggestions are grounded in a local knowledge base, powered by a vector database for intelligent, semantic searching. This ensures recommendations are relevant and context-aware.
- **Personalized Planning:** Tailor your trip by providing your interests (e.g., "hiking, history") and daily budget to get customized suggestions.
- **Custom Rest Periods:** Define a daily "sleep time" to automatically pause the itinerary, ensuring a realistic travel schedule for multi-day trips.
- **Save & Export:** Save your complete itinerary to a formatted text file for offline access.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.8 or newer recommended)
- Pip (Python package installer)
- A Google Maps API Key and a Gemini API Key

### Installation

1.  **Get your API Keys:**
    - **Google Maps:** Enable the **Directions API** in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create an API key.
    - **Gemini:** Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ai-python-trip-planner.git](https://github.com/your-username/ai-python-trip-planner.git)
    cd ai-python-trip-planner
    ```

3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    - Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
    - Add your API keys to it (use `.env.example` as a template):
      ```
      GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="PASTE_YOUR_MAPS_KEY_HERE"
      GEMINI_API_KEY="PASTE_YOUR_GEMINI_KEY_HERE"
      ```

6.  **Build your Knowledge Base:**
    - Add `.md` or `.txt` files with travel information into the `knowledge_base/` directory. The more information you provide, the smarter the AI concierge will be.

## üèÉ How to Run

Execute the main script from your terminal. The application will first build the vector database from your knowledge base and then guide you through planning your trip.

```bash
python main.py
